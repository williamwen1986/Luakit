// Platform abstraction for discardable memory. DiscardableMemory is used to
// cache large objects without worrying about blowing out memory, both on mobile
// devices where there is no swap, and desktop devices where unused free memory
// should be used to help the user experience. This is preferable to releasing
// memory in response to an OOM signal because it is simpler, though it has less
// flexibility as to which objects get discarded.
//
// Discardable memory has two states: locked and unlocked. While the memory is
// locked, it will not be discarded. Unlocking the memory allows the OS to
// reclaim it if needed. Locks do not nest.
//
// Notes:
//   - The paging behavior of memory while it is locked is not specified. While
//     mobile platforms will not swap it out, it may qualify for swapping
//     on desktop platforms. It is not expected that this will matter, as the
//     preferred pattern of usage for DiscardableMemory is to lock down the
//     memory, use it as quickly as possible, and then unlock it.
//   - Because of memory alignment, the amount of memory allocated can be
//     larger than the requested memory size. It is not very efficient for
//     small allocations.
//   - A discardable memory instance is not thread safe. It is the
//     responsibility of users of discardable memory to ensure there are no
//     races.
