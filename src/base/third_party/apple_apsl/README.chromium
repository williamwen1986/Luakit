cssmapplePriv.h from:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libsecurity_cssm/libsecurity_cssm-31536/lib/cssmapplePriv.h

Warning: Technically, this is a private Apple header, and as such provides no
guarantee for API stability. However, the use of this header is the only way
to implement OCSP checking per Apple's public documentation on the usage of
their Trust Policy Module. Further, the use of this private header is the
recommended approach from Apple for modifying OCSP policies.

See: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/Reference/SecAppleTrustPolicyModuleSpec/Apple_Trust_Policy_Module_Functional_Specification.pdf
and http://lists.apple.com/archives/apple-cdsa/2008/Aug/msg00008.html

Modifications:
- Removed unneeded definitions for internal Apple CSP DL enums and structs
- Added a suppression for the warning "-Wdeprecated-declarations" since CSSM
  APIs are deprecated since OSX 10.7.

dnsinfo.h from:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/configd/configd-453.19/dnsinfo/dnsinfo.h

Provides dns_config_t which is used by /net/dns/dns_config_service_posix.cc to
obtain system DNS configuration on Mac OS X. This private header is also used by
Apple's open source mDNSResponder.

Modifications:
- Removed Availability.h and the corresponding macros.
