  // We need to figure out if we need another thread with the lock held, which

  // a thread. When we do shutdown, we wait until the thread_being_created_
  // flag is cleared, which ensures that the new thread is properly added to
  // all the data structures and we can't leak it. Once shutdown starts, we'll

  // will cause fewer workers to be created than one would expect. It isn't

  //
  //  1. Main thread posts a bunch of unrelated tasks that would normally be
  //     run on separate threads.

  //     cause a worker to start since one is pending.
  //  3. Main thread initiates shutdown.
