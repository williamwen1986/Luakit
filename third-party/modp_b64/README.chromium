Description:
The modp_b64.c file was modified to remove the inclusion of modp's config.h
and to fix compilation errors that occur under VC8.  The file was renamed
modp_b64.cc to force it to be compiled as C++ so that the inclusion of
basictypes.h could be possible.

The file modp_b64_data.h was generated by modp_b64_gen.c (under Linux),
which is not included in this directory.  The resulting header was
modified to not include <stdint.h> when COMPILER_MSVC is defined (since
that header file does not exist under VC8), but instead in that case to
include "base/basictypes.h" and provide the required typedefs for
uint8_t and uint32_t using uint8 and uint32.

The modp_b64.cc and modp_b64.h files were modified to make them safe on
64-bit systems.
